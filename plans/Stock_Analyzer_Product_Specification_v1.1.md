## 5. Analysis Workflows

### Important: Message Processing Rules

**One Message at a Time:**
The bot processes messages sequentially, whether they are conversational questions or analysis workflows. This applies to ALL interactions:

**Conversational Questions:**
- Bot responds in 2-10 seconds typically
- While responding, shows: "üí≠ Thinking..." 
- User cannot send new messages until response complete
- New messages sent during response are queued

**Analysis Workflows:**
- Take 2-3 minutes to complete
- While running, shows: "üìä Analyzing..." with progress updates
- User cannot start new workflows or send messages
- Can use `/stop` to cancel and free up the bot

**Why This Matters:**
- Unlike web interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude), Telegram doesn't have a "send/stop" toggle button
- Bot uses response messages to show it's working
- User experience relies on clear status indicators

**Example - Conversation:**
```
User: "What's a P/E ratio?"

Bot: üí≠ Thinking...

[2 seconds later]
Bot: A P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings) shows how much...
     [Full response]

[User can now send next message]
```

**Example - Workflow:**
```
User: /analyze AAPL

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: Educational analysis only, not investment advice.
     
     üìä Analyzing AAPL... (0%)

[Updates every few seconds]
Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (15%)
     Fetching company data... ‚úì

Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (40%)
     Analyzing financial metrics... ‚úì

[Meanwhile, user tries to send message]
User: "What about Tesla?"

[Message is held/queued - bot still working on AAPL]

Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (85%)
     Generating reports... ‚úì

Bot: ‚úÖ Analysis complete!
     [PDFs delivered]

[Now bot can process queued message]
Bot: üí≠ Thinking...
Bot: Did you want me to analyze Tesla next?
     You can use /analyze TSLA
```

**Visual Status Indicators:**
- üí≠ Thinking... (conversational response)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Typing... (writing response)
- üìä Analyzing... (workflow in progress)
- üìÑ Generating PDF... (creating reports)
- ‚è≥ Please wait... (generic busy state)

**Note:** Detailed animation specifications, typing indicators, and message update patterns are documented in the separate UX/UI Specification document.

---

### Important: Workflow Execution Rules

All analysis workflows (`/analyze`, `/earnings`, `/sentiment`, `/news`) follow these rules:

**One at a Time:**
- Only ONE analysis can run per user at any given time
- User cannot queue or schedule multiple analyses
- Attempts to start a second analysis will be blocked with a helpful message

**Duration:**
- Most workflows take 2-3 minutes to complete
- Real-time streaming shows progress
- User sees updates as analysis proceeds

**Control:**
- **Stop anytime:** Use `/stop` to cancel the active analysis
- **Ask questions:** User can ask conversational questions while analysis runs (responses queued until workflow completes)
- **Wait or cancel:** If an analysis is running, user must either wait for it to finish OR use `/stop` before starting a new one

**Example Scenario:**
```
User: /analyze AAPL
Bot: üìä Starting comprehensive analysis for AAPL...
     [Streaming begins...]

[30 seconds later]
User: /earnings TSLA
Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis already running for AAPL (2m remaining)

     You can:
     ‚Ä¢ Wait for it to complete
     ‚Ä¢ Use /stop to cancel AAPL analysis
     ‚Ä¢ Ask questions (I'll respond after analysis)

User: /stop
Bot: ‚úÖ AAPL analysis stopped.

User: /earnings TSLA
Bot: üìä Analyzing latest earnings for TSLA...
     [Starting TSLA earnings analysis...]

**Always available via command:**
```
User: /disclaimer

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è FINANCIAL DISCLAIMER

     Stock Analyzer Bot provides educational financial
     analysis ONLY. This is NOT investment advice.

     Key Points:
     ‚Ä¢ We are NOT licensed financial advisors
     ‚Ä¢ We do NOT recommend specific investments
     ‚Ä¢ YOU are solely responsible for your decisions
     ‚Ä¢ All investments carry risk (including loss of principal)

     ‚úì You've read and understood this disclaimer
     ‚úì You'll conduct your own research
     ‚úì You'll consult licensed professionals before investing
     ‚úì You accept all investment risks

     üìÑ Full legal terms: [Link to complete disclaimer]

     Questions? Email: legal@stockanalyzer.bot
```

#### 8.1.3 Display Rules & Timing

**Simple disclaimer approach:**

| Event | Disclaimer Type | Frequency |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| First `/start` | Full disclaimer | Once (first use) |
| Returning `/start` | None | - |
| User requests `/disclaimer` | Full disclaimer | On demand |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Track disclaimer acknowledgment per user (boolean flag)
- No explicit "I agree" button required (passive acknowledgment)
- No disclaimers before analysis workflows
- No disclaimers in PDF reports
- No periodic re-displays

---

### 8.2 Getting Started

**First-Time User Experience:**
```
User: /start
[See disclaimer in 8.1.1]

User: "What's a good tech stock?"

Bot: That's a great question to start with!
     
     "Good" depends on your investment goals, risk
     tolerance, and time horizon. But I can help you
     analyze specific tech stocks.
     
     Popular tech stocks to analyze:
     ‚Ä¢ AAPL (Apple) - Consumer tech leader
     ‚Ä¢ MSFT (Microsoft) - Enterprise software
     ‚Ä¢ NVDA (NVIDIA) - AI/chips
     ‚Ä¢ GOOGL (Google) - Search/ads
     
     Try: /analyze AAPL
     Or ask: "Compare AAPL vs MSFT"
```

### 8.3 Response Feedback & Status Indicators

**Critical Requirement:** Users must always know when the bot is working. Unlike web chat interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude) that have send/stop toggle buttons, Telegram requires explicit status messages.

#### 8.3.1 Telegram Limitations

**No Native Stop Button:**
- Web interfaces: Send button transforms to Stop button during generation
- Telegram: No such UI element exists
- **Solution:** Use response messages with status text and emojis

**No Typing Indicator Persistence:**
- Telegram's `sendChatAction('typing')` auto-expires after 5 seconds
- Must be refreshed every 4 seconds for long operations
- **Solution:** Combine typing indicator with status messages

#### 8.3.2 Response Feedback Patterns

**For Quick Responses (< 5 seconds):**
```
User: "What's a P/E ratio?"

[Bot immediately sends]
Bot: üí≠ Thinking...

[2-3 seconds later, message is edited]
Bot: A P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings) shows...
```

**Implementation:**
- Send immediate acknowledgment message
- Show `sendChatAction('typing')` indicator
- Edit message with final response
- No need to refresh typing indicator (under 5 seconds)

**For Medium Responses (5-30 seconds):**
```
User: "Compare AAPL to MSFT"

Bot: üí≠ Analyzing...

[Typing indicator refreshed every 4 seconds]

[15 seconds later]
Bot: Here's how AAPL and MSFT compare...
```

**Implementation:**
- Send status message
- Refresh `sendChatAction('typing')` every 4 seconds
- Replace or edit with final response

**For Long Operations (Workflows, 1-3 minutes):**
```
User: /analyze AAPL

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: Educational analysis only.
     
     üìä Analyzing AAPL... (0%)

[Every 5-10 seconds, message is edited]
Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (15%)
     Fetching company data... ‚úì

Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (40%)
     Analyzing financial metrics... ‚úì

Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (85%)
     Generating reports... ‚úì

Bot: ‚úÖ Analysis complete!
     [PDFs delivered]
```

**Implementation:**
- Send initial status message
- Refresh `sendChatAction('typing')` every 4 seconds
- Update status message with progress (throttled to 1 update/second max)
- Delete or replace status message when complete
- Deliver final results in new message

#### 8.3.3 Status Message Specifications

**Visual Status Indicators:**

| State | Emoji | Text | Duration | Use Case |
|-------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Thinking | üí≠ | "Thinking..." | 2-10s | Quick questions |
| Typing | ‚úçÔ∏è | "Typing..." | 2-10s | Generating text response |
| Analyzing | üìä | "Analyzing... X%" | 1-3m | Full analysis workflows |
| Processing Earnings | üìà | "Analyzing earnings... X%" | 1-3m | Earnings workflows |
| Checking Sentiment | üì∞ | "Checking sentiment... X%" | 1-2m | Sentiment analysis |
| Fetching News | üì∞ | "Fetching news... X%" | 1-2m | News analysis |
| Generating PDF | üìÑ | "Generating PDF..." | 10-30s | Report creation |
| Waiting | ‚è≥ | "Please wait..." | Any | Generic busy state |

**Progress Updates (for workflows only):**
- Include percentage (0-100%)
- Show current phase/step
- Mark completed steps with ‚úì
- Update every 5-10 seconds (not more frequent to avoid spam)

**Examples:**
```
üìä Analyzing AAPL... (25%)
Analyzing financial metrics...

üìä Analyzing AAPL... (60%)
Fetching company data... ‚úì
Analyzing financial metrics... ‚úì
Calculating valuations...

üìä Analyzing AAPL... (90%)
Fetching company data... ‚úì
Analyzing financial metrics... ‚úì
Calculating valuations... ‚úì
Generating reports...
```

#### 8.3.4 User Cannot Interrupt Patterns

**During Conversational Response:**
```
User: "What's a P/E ratio?"
Bot: üí≠ Thinking...

[User tries to send another message]
User: "Actually, tell me about PEG"

[First response completes]
Bot: A P/E ratio shows...

[Then second question is processed]
Bot: üí≠ Thinking...
Bot: A PEG ratio is...
```

**Behavior:** Messages are queued and processed sequentially

**During Workflow:**
```
User: /analyze AAPL
Bot: üìä Analyzing AAPL... (15%)

[User tries to send new command]
User: /analyze TSLA

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis already running for AAPL (2m remaining)
     
     You can:
     ‚Ä¢ Wait for completion
     ‚Ä¢ Use /stop to cancel
     ‚Ä¢ Ask questions (queued until done)
```

**Behavior:** New workflows blocked, conversational messages queued

#### 8.3.5 Implementation Requirements

**Must Have:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate acknowledgment (< 1 second)
- ‚úÖ Status message with emoji indicator
- ‚úÖ Telegram typing indicator (`sendChatAction`)
- ‚úÖ Progress updates for long operations
- ‚úÖ Clear completion signal
- ‚úÖ Message editing (not spam with new messages)

**Technical Specs:**
- Typing indicator refresh: Every 4 seconds
- Status message updates: Max 1 per second (Telegram rate limit)
- Progress percentage: Rounded to nearest 5%
- Message edits: Use `editMessageText` API
- Final cleanup: Delete status message OR replace with results

**Reference:**
Detailed animation timing, message transition effects, and mobile-specific UI patterns are documented in the separate **UX/UI Specification** document.

- Suggest alternatives
- Never leave users stuck

### 8.5 Error Handling

**Invalid Ticker:**
```
User: /analyze INVALID

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è "INVALID" doesn't appear to be a valid ticker symbol.

     Did you mean:
     ‚Ä¢ NVDA (NVIDIA)
     ‚Ä¢ INTC (Intel)
     
     Or search: /search chip manufacturer
```

**Workflow Already Running:**
```
User: /analyze MSFT

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis already running for AAPL (1m 30s remaining)
     
     You can:
     ‚Ä¢ Wait for it to complete, then try again
     ‚Ä¢ Use /stop to cancel AAPL analysis
     ‚Ä¢ Ask me questions (I can respond while analyzing)
     
     Cannot queue multiple analyses.
```

**Earnings Not Yet Released:**
```
User: /earnings AAPL Q1-2025

Bot: ‚ö†Ô∏è Q1 2025 earnings for AAPL haven't been released yet.
     
     Expected date: January 30, 2025 (38 days from now)
     
     Want me to:
     1Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Q4 2024 earnings (latest available)
     2Ô∏è‚É£ Add to watchlist and notify when Q1 reports
     3Ô∏è‚É£ Show historical earnings pattern

## 10. User Flows

### 10.1 New User Onboarding

```
User: [Starts bot for first time]

Bot: üëã Welcome to Stock Analyzer!
     
     I can help you research stocks and understand earnings.
     
     Try these:
     ‚Ä¢ "Analyze Apple's latest earnings"
     ‚Ä¢ /earnings TSLA
     ‚Ä¢ "What's the difference between P/E and PEG?"

User: "What's the difference between P/E and PEG?"

Bot: Great question! Here's the key difference:
     
     üìä P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)
     ‚Ä¢ Shows: What you pay for $1 of earnings
     ‚Ä¢ Formula: Stock Price √∑ Earnings Per Share
     ‚Ä¢ Example: If stock is $100 and EPS is $5, P/E = 20
     
     üìà PEG Ratio (P/E-to-Growth)
     ‚Ä¢ Shows: P/E adjusted for growth rate
     ‚Ä¢ Formula: P/E √∑ Annual EPS Growth Rate
     ‚Ä¢ Example: P/E of 20 with 20% growth = PEG of 1.0
     
     üí° Rule of Thumb:
     ‚Ä¢ PEG < 1 = potentially undervalued
     ‚Ä¢ PEG > 2 = potentially overvalued
     ‚Ä¢ PEG ‚âà 1 = fairly valued
