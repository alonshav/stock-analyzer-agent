## Framework Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach for valuing growth companies during their critical transition from being valued on revenue multiples to being valued on sustainable earnings and free cash flow. **Version 2.3 Update:** Reorganized into six clear phases that mirror the actual analysis workflow from setup through final decision.

The core objective is to de-risk investment decisions by quantifying the potential for ‚Äúmultiple compression‚Äù‚Äîthe phenomenon where a company‚Äôs valuation multiple shrinks as its growth decelerates with maturity. The framework achieves this through three key mechanisms: (1) staging companies based on their profitability profile from ‚ÄúPre-Profit‚Äù to ‚ÄúEarnings-Anchored,‚Äù (2) applying ‚Äúhandoff tests‚Äù that translate current revenue-based valuations into required future earnings power, and (3) conducting comprehensive quality assessments of revenue streams, cash conversion efficiency, and competitive positioning to identify durable compounders while avoiding value traps where growth expectations disconnect from plausible long-term profitability.

### Six-Phase Analysis Process

**PHASE 1: SETUP & PREPARATION (20 minutes)**

- Understand framework requirements and data integrity standards
- Classify company stage and determine primary metrics to focus on
- Plan data collection and analysis approach

**PHASE 2: DATA COLLECTION & VERIFICATION (15 minutes)**

- Verify current market data and recent earnings information
- Extract management guidance and forward-looking commentary
- Set up core valuation calculation framework

**PHASE 3: CORE ANALYSIS (30 minutes)**

- Analyze revenue quality, customer metrics, and unit economics
- Examine growth trajectory patterns and sustainability
- Calculate and assess free cash flow generation

**PHASE 4: VALUATION TESTING (20 minutes)**

- Run handoff tests to identify multiple compression risks
- Calculate Rule of 40 and benchmark against peers
- Model various scenarios for future performance

**PHASE 5: QUALITY & RISK ASSESSMENT (15 minutes)**

- Score company across six quality dimensions
- Compare against industry benchmarks
- Identify key risks and potential pitfalls

**PHASE 6: DECISION & IMPLEMENTATION (10 minutes)**

- Synthesize analysis into investment recommendation
- Create executive summary
- Document key assumptions and risk factors

**Total Time Investment: ~110 minutes for comprehensive analysis**

### Executive Summary Output Requirement

**CRITICAL:** When conducting an analysis using this framework, you must create TWO separate outputs:

1. **Executive Summary (Separate File/Canvas)**: A concise 1-2 page summary containing:

- Company name and analysis date
- Current valuation metrics (TTM and FWD P/E, P/S, EV/Sales)
- The three handoff test results with clear risk assessment
- Quality score (out of 18) and compression risk rating
- Final investment recommendation with key supporting rationale
- Top 3 risks and top 3 opportunities

1. **Full Analysis Report**: Complete detailed analysis following all framework sections

The executive summary enables quick decision-making while the full report provides comprehensive backup and documentation.

-----

# PHASE 1: SETUP & PREPARATION

## 1. Foundational Principle: Data Integrity & External Validation

**CRITICAL: The integrity of this framework‚Äôs output is entirely dependent on the quality and verification of its inputs. This verification protocol is a mandatory prerequisite for the analysis.**

### Why Quarterly Data Recency is Critical

**Growth companies change rapidly.** Using quarterly earnings data that is 3+ months stale can lead to:

- **Valuation miscalculations** due to outdated revenue/margin assumptions
- **Incorrect quality assessments** based on superseded financial performance
- **Flawed handoff test results** that miss recent profitability improvements or deteriorations
- **Framework credibility loss** when recommendations are based on obsolete information

**Example Impact:** A company reporting surprise profitability in Q1 would be incorrectly classified as ‚ÄúPre-Profit‚Äù if using Q4 data, leading to wrong valuation metrics and investment conclusions.

### Primary Source Verification Requirements

- **Historical Financial Data**: All historical financial data (revenue, margins, cash flow, share count, stock-based compensation, etc.) **must be sourced and verified directly** from the company‚Äôs official filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as Form 10-K (annual reports) and Form 10-Q (quarterly reports), or the equivalent regulatory body for international companies.
  - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Do not rely on unverified third-party data aggregators as the final source
  - **Verification Steps**: Cross-check at least 3 key metrics (revenue, net income, cash flow) against the original SEC filings
  - **Documentation**: Cite specific filing dates and page numbers for all data sources
- **MANDATORY QUARTERLY DATA RECENCY**: Analysis **must** incorporate the most recent quarterly earnings data available at the time of analysis.
  - **Current Quarter Priority**: If a quarterly earnings report (10-Q) has been published more recently than the annual report (10-K), the quarterly data takes precedence for TTM calculations
  - **Quarterly Verification Protocol**: Verify that you are using the most recent quarterly filing available by checking:
  1. Company investor relations website for latest earnings announcement
  1. SEC EDGAR database for most recent 10-Q filing
  1. Major financial news sources for recent earnings reports
  - **Stale Data Prohibition**: Using quarterly data that is >90 days old when more recent data is available constitutes a critical framework violation
  - **Documentation Requirement**: State explicitly which quarter‚Äôs data was used and confirm it represents the most current information available

### Market Consensus Validation

- **Analyst Consensus Comparison**: Your forward-looking assumptions (e.g., revenue growth, target margins, terminal multiples) **must be benchmarked against mainstream market expectations** from at least 3 different sources:
  - **Professional Platforms**: Bloomberg Terminal, Refinitiv Eikon, FactSet, S&P Capital IQ
  - **Investment Research**: Major investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, etc.)
  - **Independent Research**: Morningstar, Zacks, Yahoo Finance consensus estimates
  - **Justification Required**: If your assumptions deviate >15% from consensus, provide detailed rationale

### Peer Group Benchmarking Protocol

- **Comparable Company Selection**: Key metrics and assumptions, especially target margins and steady-state P/E multiples, **must be validated against a carefully selected group of direct, publicly-traded competitors.**
  - **Minimum Requirements**: At least 5 direct competitors with similar business models
  - **Industry Benchmarks**: Reference industry reports from McKinsey, Bain, BCG, or specialized research firms
  - **Reality Check**: Target margins must be within the 75th percentile of peer group performance unless exceptional circumstances are documented

### Information Verification Checklist

**MANDATORY: Before using any metric, assumption, or industry benchmark in your analysis, verify that:**

‚òê **Official Source Confirmation**: The information comes from official company filings, regulatory bodies, or established financial data providers

‚òê **Quarterly Data Recency**: You are using the most recent quarterly earnings data available (check SEC filings, investor relations, earnings announcements within past 90 days)

‚òê **Multiple Source Cross-Check**: The same information is confirmed across at least 2 independent, credible sources

‚òê **Recency Validation**: The information is current (within 90 days for quarterly financial data, within 6 months for annual data, 1 year for industry benchmarks)

‚òê **Peer Comparison**: Assumptions are benchmarked against actual performance of comparable companies

‚òê **Expert Analysis Cross-Reference**: Key assumptions align with analysis from reputable investment research firms or financial institutions

‚òê **Market Consensus Check**: Forward estimates are compared against mainstream analyst consensus (Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.)

### Prohibited Information Sources & Critical Violations

**DO NOT USE** the following as primary sources without verification:

- Wikipedia or crowd-sourced platforms
- Unverified social media posts or forums
- Company investor presentations without SEC filing cross-reference
- Single-source third-party estimates without corroboration
- Outdated industry reports (>2 years old)
- AI-generated content without human expert validation

**CRITICAL FRAMEWORK VIOLATIONS** (analysis must be restarted if these occur):

- Using quarterly financial data that is >90 days old when more recent data is available
- Using stale stock price data (>24 hours old)
- Relying on unverified third-party aggregators as primary data source
- Forward estimates that deviate >15% from consensus without documented justification
- Target margins/multiples not benchmarked against industry peer performance

### Documentation Standards

- **Source Attribution**: Every metric, assumption, and benchmark must include specific source citation
- **Date Stamps**: All data points must include the date of the underlying information
- **Deviation Explanations**: Any assumptions that differ from market consensus must include detailed justification with supporting evidence
- **Confidence Levels**: Assign confidence ratings (High/Medium/Low) based on source quality and verification completeness

-----

## 2. Company Development Stages

This model classifies companies into three distinct stages to apply the most relevant valuation metrics and analytical focus for each phase of maturity.

### Stage 1: Pre-Profit

- **Characteristics**: GAAP net income < 0; Heavy investment in growth and market capture.
- **Primary Metrics**: EV/Sales (TTM & FWD), EV/Bookings, Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate.
- **Key Focus**: Path to profitability, unit economics (LTV/CAC), gross margin trajectory, cash runway.

### Stage 2: Transition Zone

- **Characteristics**: Intermittent or newly achieved profitability; P/E ratios (TTM & FWD) are often volatile and not yet meaningful.
- **Primary Metrics**: EV/EBITDA (TTM & FWD), EV/FCF, adjusted earnings.
- **Key Focus**: Margin expansion trajectory, FCF conversion quality, consistency of profitability.

### Stage 3: Earnings-Anchored

- **Characteristics**: Sustainable and predictable GAAP profitability; Stable operating margins.
- **Primary Metrics**: P/E (TTM & FWD), EV/FCF, EV/EBITDA.
- **Key Focus**: Quality of earnings, capital efficiency, and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

-----

## 3. Essential Data Requirements

Accurate analysis requires gathering the following financial data for at least the trailing three years and forward two years. **All historical data must be verified against SEC filings.**

- **P/S Ratios**: TTM and Forward based on next 12-month revenue estimates
- **EV/Sales**: TTM and Forward
- **EV/EBITDA**: TTM and Forward (when applicable)

-----

## 4. Visual Analysis Guidelines: When to Create Infographics

**Strategic Use of Visuals**: Infographics and charts should only be created when they significantly enhance understanding of complex data relationships. Avoid visual clutter that doesn‚Äôt add analytical value.

### Detailed Visualization Matrix: When to Use Which Chart Type

#### 1. **Line Charts** - For Time-Series Trends

**Use When:**

- Historical financial progression (revenue, margins, FCF over 3+ years)
- Rule of 40 progression over time (growth rate + FCF margin)

- Handoff test risk assessment (implied P/E vs. required margin)

**Framework Applications:**

- Section 12 (Rule of 40): Growth rate (X) vs. FCF margin (Y), with 40% diagonal line
- Section 11 (Handoff Tests): Current P/S (X) vs. Implied P/E at target margin (Y)
- Section 8 (Revenue Analysis): CAC payback period (X) vs. LTV/CAC ratio (Y)

#### 4. **Waterfall Charts** - For Bridge Analysis

**Use When:**

- Cash flow bridge (from EBITDA to Free Cash Flow)
- Revenue bridge (prior year to current year components)
- Margin expansion analysis (gross margin to net margin)

**Framework Applications:**

- Section 10 (FCF Analysis): EBITDA ‚Üí FCF conversion showing each adjustment
- Revenue growth decomposition (organic growth, acquisitions, price increases)

### Specific Visualizations for Growth Analysis

#### For Section 9 (Growth Trajectory):

**Required Visual**: Multi-line chart showing:

- X-axis: Time periods (quarterly for 3 years)
- Y-axis 1: Revenue absolute values
- Y-axis 2: YoY growth percentage
- Separate lines for: Total revenue, Cloud/SaaS revenue, Core product revenue
- Annotations for major events (acquisitions, product launches)

**Optional Visual**: Waterfall chart showing:

- FX impact
- Price/volume breakdown
- Current year revenue

### DO NOT CREATE Infographics for:

- Simple metrics (single data points)
- Text-heavy content (methodologies, assumptions)
- Standard tables (income statement line items)

### Visualization Consistency Standards

#### Color Scheme (Use Consistently):

- **Green**: Excellent performance, low risk
- **Yellow/Orange**: Moderate performance, medium risk
- **Red**: Poor performance, high risk
- **Blue**: Neutral/benchmark data
- **Gray**: Supporting information

-----

# PHASE 2: DATA COLLECTION & VERIFICATION

## 5. Real-Time Market Data Verification

### Current Market Data Verification ‚ö° **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**

**COMPLETE BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS:**

- [ ] **Current Stock Price:** $____ (source: _____, timestamp: _____)
- [ ] **Market Cap:** $____M (calculated: shares √ó price)
- [ ] **Data Age:** <24 hours old ‚úÖ / >24 hours old ‚ùå

**If market data >24 hours old:** STOP - get current data before proceeding

**Cross-Check Required:**

- Verify price on 2+ sources (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.)
- Confirm market is open/closed and adjust for after-hours if needed
- Note any recent news that might affect pricing

**Why This Matters:** Wrong price = wrong market cap = wrong all multiples = invalid analysis

-----

## 6. Management Guidance Capture

### Earnings Call Integration **REQUIRED**

**From Latest Earnings Call Transcript:**

- [ ] **Specific revenue/margin guidance** with timelines
- [ ] **Announced deals/partnerships** with dollar values and probability
- [ ] **Management confidence language** (‚Äúexpect‚Äù vs ‚Äúhope‚Äù vs ‚Äútargeting‚Äù)
- [ ] **Resource allocation priorities** (where are they investing incremental capital?)
- [ ] **Competitive positioning** updates and market share commentary

**Integration Rule:** If management guidance differs >15% from your financial analysis, explain the gap and adjust scenarios accordingly.

**Confidence Language Decoder:**

- **‚ÄúExpect/Will‚Äù**: High confidence (>80% probability)
- **‚ÄúTargeting/Plan‚Äù**: Medium confidence (60-80% probability)
- **‚ÄúHope/Believe‚Äù**: Low confidence (40-60% probability)
- **‚ÄúExploring/Considering‚Äù**: Very low confidence (<40% probability)

### Growth Catalyst Analysis **MANDATORY**

**Answer These Questions:**

- [ ] **What specific deals/initiatives** has management announced with timelines?
- [ ] **What‚Äôs the revenue value** and probability of each initiative?
- [ ] **How do margins** on new initiatives compare to core business?
- [ ] **What resources are required** for execution vs what company has available?

**Simple Catalyst Scoring:**

- **High Impact Catalysts (>20% revenue impact):** List and assign probability (High/Med/Low)
- **Medium Impact Catalysts (5-20% revenue impact):** Note briefly
- **Low Impact Catalysts (<5% revenue impact):** Acknowledge but don‚Äôt model

**Examples of High Impact Catalysts:**

- Strategic partnerships with guaranteed minimums
- New product launches with secured distribution
- Geographic expansion with regulatory approvals in hand
- Acquisition pipeline with signed LOIs
- New business models (e.g., recurring revenue transformation)

-----

## 7. Core Valuation Bridges

These fundamental identities are the mathematical core of the framework, translating revenue multiples into their earnings-based equivalents.

### Fundamental Identities

**Revenue to Earnings Bridge:**
$$P/S = \text{Net Profit Margin} \times P/E$$
$$\implies P/E = \frac{P/S}{\text{Net Profit Margin}}$$

**Enterprise Value Bridges:**
$$EV/Sales = \text{EBITDA Margin} \times EV/EBITDA$$
$$EV/Sales = \text{FCF Margin} \times EV/FCF$$

**Total Return Decomposition:**
This provides a conceptual model for long-term shareholder returns.
$$\text{Total Return} \approx (\text{Revenue Growth} \times \text{Margin Expansion} \times \text{Multiple Change}) - \text{Dilution Impact}$$

-----

# PHASE 3: CORE ANALYSIS

## 8. Revenue Stream Quality & Durability Analysis

Not all revenue is created equal. A comprehensive assessment of revenue quality is crucial before applying valuation multiples.

### Revenue Composition Analysis

#### 1. Revenue Type Classification

- **Recurring Revenue**: Subscription fees, maintenance contracts, SaaS revenue
  - **Target**: >70% for SaaS companies, >50% for hybrid models
  - **Quality Score**: High predictability and visibility
- **Non-Recurring Revenue**: One-time sales, professional services, implementation fees
  - **Considerations**: Often lower margin, less predictable
- **Transaction-Based Revenue**: Commission, usage-based, transaction fees
  - **Volatility**: Higher variability but potentially scalable

#### 2. Revenue Recognition Quality

- **Cash vs. Accrual**: Analyze timing differences between recognized revenue and cash collection
- **Deferred Revenue**: Strong indicator of future revenue visibility (especially for SaaS)
- **Contract Terms**: Length of contracts, payment terms, renewal patterns

### Customer Analysis Framework

#### Customer Concentration Risk

- **Top 5 Customers**: % of total revenue

  - **Excellent**: LTV/CAC >5x
  - **Good**: LTV/CAC 3-5x
  - **Minimum Viable**: LTV/CAC >3x
  - **Unsustainable**: LTV/CAC <3x

### Pricing Power Indicators

- **Price Increase History**: Track record of successful price increases without significant churn
- **Price Elasticity**: Customer response to pricing changes
- **Competitive Positioning**: Pricing relative to alternatives
- **Switching Costs**: Technical, financial, or operational barriers to customer departure

-----

## 9. Growth Trajectory & Trend Analysis

This section provides a systematic approach to analyzing growth patterns, identifying inflection points, and understanding the valuation implications of growth deceleration or acceleration.

### Historical Growth Pattern Analysis

#### Core Revenue Growth Metrics

**Compile 3-5 Year History:**

|Year   |Total Revenue|YoY Growth %|Organic Growth %|M&A Contribution %|
|-------|-------------|------------|----------------|------------------|
|Y-3    |$____M       |____%       |____%           |____%             |
|Y-2    |$____M       |____%       |____%           |____%             |
|Y-1    |$____M       |____%       |____%           |____%             |
|Current|$____M       |____%       |____%           |____%             |
|Guided |$____M       |____%       |____%           |____%             |

**Growth Classification:**

- **Hyper-Growth**: >40% YoY
- **High Growth**: 25-40% YoY
- **Moderate Growth**: 15-25% YoY
- **Mature Growth**: 5-15% YoY
- **Low/No Growth**: <5% YoY

### Growth Deceleration/Acceleration Analysis

#### Deceleration Pattern Recognition

**Calculate Sequential Deceleration:**

```
Deceleration Rate = (Prior Year Growth % - Current Year Growth %) / Prior Year Growth %
```

**Deceleration Severity Assessment:**

- **Mild**: <20% deceleration rate
- **Moderate**: 20-40% deceleration rate
- **Severe**: >40% deceleration rate
- **Cliff**: Growth rate drops by >50% in single year

### Growth Quality Assessment

**Analyze Growth Drivers:**

- **Volume vs. Price**: Is growth from new customers or price increases?
- **Core vs. Adjacent**: Growth from existing products or new initiatives?
- **Retention vs. New**: NRR contribution vs. new customer acquisition?
- **Geographic Mix**: Domestic maturity vs. international expansion?

### Growth Sustainability Indicators

#### Leading Indicators to Monitor

**Pipeline & Bookings Metrics:**

- **Bookings Growth**: Leading indicator of future revenue
- **Pipeline Coverage**: Pipeline value / quarterly target
- **Deal Velocity**: Average time from lead to close
- **Win Rate Trends**: Conversion rate changes

**Investment Intensity:**

- **S&M as % of Revenue**: Trending up or down?
- **S&M Efficiency**: New ARR / S&M spend
- **R&D Investment**: Product innovation spending trends
- **Geographic Expansion**: New market entry costs

### Growth Scenario Modeling

**Three-Scenario Growth Framework:**

|Scenario|Assumptions                              |Year 1|Year 2|Year 3|3-Yr CAGR|
|--------|-----------------------------------------|------|------|------|---------|
|**Bull**|New products succeed, market share gains |___%  |___%  |___%  |___%     |
|**Base**|Current trajectory continues             |___%  |___%  |___%  |___%     |
|**Bear**|Competition intensifies, execution issues|___%  |___%  |___%  |___%     |

-----

## 10. Free Cash Flow Analysis

Free cash flow is the lifeblood of a business and a critical anchor for valuation as a company matures.

### Operating Leverage Calculator **MANDATORY**

```
Revenue Growth Rate: _____%
OpEx Growth Rate: _____%
Incremental Margin = (Revenue Growth - OpEx Growth) / Revenue Growth = _____%
```

**Operating Leverage Assessment:**

- **If Incremental Margin >40%:** üü¢ Flag as HIGH operating leverage opportunity
- **If Incremental Margin 20-40%:** üü° MODERATE leverage
- **If Incremental Margin <20%:** üî¥ LIMITED leverage

**Why This Matters:** Operating leverage can dramatically amplify profit growth beyond revenue growth, often creating the biggest value creation opportunities.

### Free Cash Flow Calculations

#### FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity)

This represents the cash available to be distributed to equity shareholders after all expenses and reinvestments.
$$\text{FCFE} = \text{CFO} - \text{CapEx}$$

#### FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm)

This represents the total cash generated for all capital providers (both debt and equity holders).
$$\text{FCFF} = \text{CFO} + [\text{Interest Expense} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})] - \text{CapEx}$$

### FCF Quality Assessment

#### FCF/EBITDA Conversion

This metric measures how effectively a company converts its reported EBITDA into actual cash flow.
$$\text{FCF Conversion} = \frac{\text{Free Cash Flow}}{\text{EBITDA}}$$

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

- **Excellent**: FCF Conversion >80%
- **Good**: FCF Conversion 50-80%
- **Concerning**: FCF Conversion <50%

#### FCF Margin Analysis

$$\text{FCF Margin} = \frac{\text{Free Cash Flow}}{\text{Revenue}}$$

**Industry Targets:**

- **SaaS/Software**: 15-25% FCF margin
- **Marketplaces**: 10-20% FCF margin
- **Fintech**: 10-18% FCF margin
- **E-commerce**: 5-12% FCF margin

-----

# PHASE 4: VALUATION TESTING

## 11. The Three Critical Handoff Tests

These tests are designed to pressure-test a company‚Äôs current valuation against the realities of its future profitability requirements. **All assumptions must be benchmarked against mature industry peers.**

### Test 1: Implied P/E Analysis

**Question**: What P/E ratio does the current P/S (or EV/Sales) ratio imply at a reasonable, mature-state target margin?

**Formula**:
$$\text{Implied P/E} = \frac{\text{Current P/S}}{\text{Target Net Margin}}$$

**Interpretation**: If the Implied P/E is excessively high (e.g., >50x for a scaled company), the stock faces significant multiple compression risk as growth slows.

### Test 2: Required Margin Analysis

**Question**: What net margin does the company need to achieve to justify its current valuation at a reasonable mature-state P/E multiple?

**Formula**:
$$\text{Required Margin} = \frac{\text{Current P/S}}{\text{Target Steady-State P/E}}$$

**Interpretation**: Compare this required margin to best-in-class competitors. Is it achievable or does it require heroic assumptions?

### Test 3: Scale Requirements

**Question**: How much annual revenue must the company generate to justify its current market capitalization?

**Formula**:
$$\text{Required Revenue} = \frac{\text{Current Market Cap}}{\text{Target Margin} \times \text{Target P/E}}$$

**Interpretation**: Express this as a multiple of current revenue (e.g., ‚ÄúThe company needs to 5x its revenue‚Ä¶‚Äù). This makes the abstract valuation tangible.

-----

## 12. Rule of 40 Assessment

A popular heuristic in SaaS and software that provides a quick check on the health of a company‚Äôs growth/profitability trade-off.

### Definition

$$\text{Rule of 40} = \text{Revenue Growth Rate (%)} + \text{FCF Margin (%)}$$

### Interpretation Guidelines

- **‚â• 40%**: Indicates a healthy balance of aggressive growth and sound financial management
- **30-40%**: Acceptable, particularly if the trajectory is improving
- **< 30%**: A potential red flag suggesting either too slow growth for cash burn or insufficient profitability for maturity

### Growth Stage Adjustments

**Consider the Company‚Äôs Maturity:**

- **Early Stage (Pre-Profit)**: May score <40% but improving trajectory is key
- **Growth Stage**: Should consistently hit 40%+
- **Mature Stage**: May score 30-40% with higher weight on profitability

-----

## 13. Scenario Analysis Framework

This grid helps visualize potential returns under different assumptions about the company‚Äôs future performance. **All modeled assumptions must be stress-tested against analyst consensus.**

### Key Variables to Model

1. **Revenue Growth**: Base, Bull, and Bear cases for the next 3-5 years
1. **Margin Evolution**: The path to the terminal (mature-state) margin assumption
1. **Terminal Multiple Scenarios**: Potential P/E or EV/FCF multiples upon maturity
1. **Dilution Impact**: Assumed annual share count growth

### Scenario Grid Template

|Scenario|5-Year Revenue CAGR|Terminal FCF Margin|Terminal EV/FCF Multiple|Implied 5-Year IRR|

# PHASE 5: QUALITY & RISK ASSESSMENT

## 14. Quality Assessment Scoring

A scoring system to objectively rate the investment profile. Score each dimension from 0 (worst) to 3 (best).

### Enhanced Scoring Dimensions (0-18 Scale)

#### 1. Profitability Stability (0-3 points)

- **3**: Stable GAAP profitability and robust FCF
- **2**: Mostly stable GAAP or consistently positive FCF
- **1**: Noisy GAAP results, FCF near zero
- **0**: Highly volatile metrics, negative FCF

#### 2. Multiple Compression Risk (0-3 points)

- **3**: Already trading at reasonable steady-state multiples
- **2**: Manageable gap, implied multiples within peer range
- **1**: Large gap, requires above-peer performance
- **0**: Massive gap requiring unrealistic assumptions

#### 3. Cash Conversion Quality (0-3 points)

- **3**: >15% FCF margin or >80% FCF/EBITDA conversion
- **2**: 5-15% FCF margin or 50-80% conversion
- **1**: 0-5% FCF margin or 30-50% conversion
- **0**: Negative FCF margin or <30% conversion

#### 4. Dilution Management (0-3 points)

- **3**: <1% annual dilution or active buybacks
- **2**: 1-3% annual dilution
- **1**: 3-5% annual dilution
- **0**: >5% annual dilution

#### 5. Competitive Position/Moat (0-3 points)

- **3**: Best-in-class metrics (NRR >130%), clear pricing power
- **2**: Good retention (NRR >110%), stable unit economics
- **1**: Mixed indicators, signs of rising competition
- **0**: Weak retention (NRR <100%), rising CAC

#### 6. Forward Momentum Assessment (0-3 points)

- **3**: High-impact catalysts with >70% probability of success
- **2**: Moderate catalysts or high-impact with 40-70% probability
- **1**: Some catalysts but low impact or probability
- **0**: No meaningful catalysts or high execution risk

### Total Score Interpretation

- **15-18**: **Exceptional** - Premium quality, very low compression risk
- **12-14**: **Resilient** - Low compression risk, high-quality business
- **8-11**: **Balanced** - Moderate risk, requires careful monitoring
- **4-7**: **Fragile** - High compression risk, significant concerns
- **0-3**: **Severe** - Severe valuation and business model concerns

## 15. Industry Benchmarks

**Important**: Always compare a company to its specific, direct peers and verify these ranges against current market data.

### Software/SaaS

- **Net Margin**: 15-30%
- **FCF Margin**: 15-25%
- **Rule of 40**: ‚â•40% is the gold standard
- **Steady-State P/E**: 30-50x

### Marketplaces/Platforms

- **EBITDA Margin**: 20-35%
- **FCF Margin**: 10-20%
- **Key Metric**: Take-rate trends
- **Steady-State P/E**: 25-40x

### Fintech/Payments

- **Net Margin**: 10-20%
- **FCF Margin**: 10-18%
- **Key Metric**: Credit quality, transaction volume
- **Steady-State P/E**: 20-35x

### E-commerce/Logistics

- **Net Margin**: 5-15%
- **FCF Margin**: 5-12%
- **Key Issue**: Highly working capital intensive
- **Steady-State P/E**: 15-30x

## 16. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Calculation Errors

- Confusing enterprise value (for all capital providers) and equity value (for shareholders)
- Forgetting to add lease liabilities to total debt when calculating EV
- Using basic share count instead of fully diluted
- Ignoring the dilutive effect of convertible securities

### Quality Adjustments

- Not normalizing earnings for one-time events or gains/losses
- Ignoring stock-based compensation, a real economic cost
- Mistaking bookings (contracted revenue) for recognized revenue
- Forgetting to add capitalized software back to CapEx for accurate FCF

### Analytical Mistakes

- Relying solely on EBITDA without cross-referencing FCF
- Ignoring significant changes in working capital
- Missing deterioration in unit economics (LTV/CAC ratio falling)
- Underestimating long-term impact of shareholder dilution
- Failing to analyze growth trajectory and its impact on valuation

# PHASE 6: DECISION & IMPLEMENTATION

## 17. Decision Framework

Use the output of the analysis to guide an investment decision.

### Strong Buy Indicators

- Quality score ‚â• 15
- Handoff tests show minimal (<20%) compression risk
- FCF conversion > 70%
- Rule of 40 consistently > 50%
- Strong NRR (>120%)
- High-impact growth catalysts with >70% probability
- Growth deceleration already priced in (low forward multiples)

### Hold/Watch Indicators

- Quality score 12-14
- Moderate compression risk (20-40%)
- FCF conversion 40-70%
- Rule of 40 between 30-40%
- Some growth catalysts but moderate impact/probability
- Growth trajectory uncertain, multiple scenarios possible

### Avoid/Sell Indicators

- Quality score < 12
- High compression risk (>40%)
- Negative or declining FCF conversion
- Rule of 40 < 30% with no clear improvement path
- No meaningful growth catalysts or high execution risk
- Severe growth deceleration not reflected in valuation

## Disclaimer

**This framework is a tool for structuring analysis, not a substitute for rigorous due diligence and independent verification.** It is designed for analytical and educational purposes and should be used as one component of a comprehensive investment process. All calculations **must** be verified against primary source documents (10-K, 10-Q). Assumptions regarding target margins and multiples **must** be benchmarked against industry peers and market consensus estimates to ensure they are grounded in reality. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
